Hello Sir/Madam,
This app is about replicating a cryptocurrency coins page of a crypto app.

-> Created a search bar to find particular coins.
-> A user friendly bottom navigation bar.

New learnings from this project :
-> Learnt about how to used the the web sockets efficiently.
-> How to handle search query when the web socket is sending data continously.
